#Intact

Intact is the product of a 56 hour hackathon in Denver, CO sponsored by Barrick Gold. Four challenges existed and each team was charged with solving one of four with technology. My team, the Risk Ninjas, chose to help digitize the Field Level Risk Assessment execution and submission process.


We started by building a web dashboard that Barrick liked so much they invited the Risk Ninjas to Salt Lake City for round two. Our task was to turn that web dashboard into a full scale prototype iOS application. We chose React Native and Node JS and completed the prototype just in time.
